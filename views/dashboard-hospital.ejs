                1. At Hackdoc, we believe there is a better way to have a connection between the Hospitals and Patients.<br> 
                2. Generally, people lose their loved ones or their condition becomes serious just because of being unaware about the current scenario of hospitals.<br>
                3. Using this app, they can know about the currently available facilities within the hospital, like availability of ventilators, beds, ICU wards etc.,  around their locality. <br>
                4. On addition to this, people may also know about the symptoms and cure of the most common diseases. We are curious to help the society through our platform.<br>
